    <string name="standard_2">Integrated Writing Scoring Rubric////Here is the official Scoring Guide used by raters when they read the Integrated////Writing Task.////Score 5////A response at this level successfully selects the important information from the lecture and coherently and accurately presents this information in relation to the relevant information presented in the reading. The response is well organized, and occasional language errors that are present do not result in inaccurate or imprecise presentation of content or connections.////Score 4////A response at this level is generally good in selecting the important information from the lecture and in coherently and accurately presenting this information in relation to the relevant information in the reading, but it may have minor omission, inaccuracy, vagueness, or imprecision of some content from the lecture or in connection to points made in the reading. A response is also scored at this level if it has more frequent or noticeable minor language errors, as long as such usage and grammatical structures do not result in anything more than an occasional lapse of clarity or in the connection of ideas.////Score 3////A response at this level contains some important information from the lecture and conveys some relevant connection to the reading, but it is marked by one or more of the following:////1)	Although the overall response is definitely oriented to the task, it conveys only vague, global, unclear, or somewhat imprecise connection of the points made in the lecture to points made in the reading.////2)	The response may omit one major key point made in the lecture.////3)	Some key points made in the lecture or the reading, or connections between the two, may be incomplete, inaccurate, or imprecise.////4)	Errors of usage and/or grammar may be more frequent or may result in noticeably vague expressions or obscured meanings in conveying ideas and connections.////Score 2////A response at this level contains some relevant information from the lecture, but is marked by significant language difficulties or by significant omission or inaccuracy of important ideas from the lecture or in the connections between the lecture and the reading; a response at this level is marked by one or more of the following:////1)	The response significantly misrepresents or completely omits the overall connection between the lecture and the reading.////2)	The response significantly omits or significantly misrepresents important points made in the lecture.////3)	The response contains language errors or expressions that largely obscure connections or meaning at key junctures, or that would likely obscure understanding of key ideas for a reader not already familiar with the reading and the lecture.////Score 1////A response at this level is marked by one or more of the following:////1)	The response provides little or no meaningful or relevant coherent content from the lecture.////2)	The language level of the response is so low that it is difficult to derive meaning.////Score 0 ////A response at this level merely copies sentences from the reading, rejects the topic or is otherwise not connected to the topic, is written////////</string>
    <string name="standard_3">总的来说托福写作的要求主要存在于如下四个方面:////　　1、观点明确////　　在五分标准当中的第一条就提到了这一点。观点的表明主要存在于开头段和结尾段。开头段阐明观点，结尾段则是重述观点。在这里开头段的观点一定要鲜明，结尾与开头的观点则必须一致。////　　2、论证充分////　　这是中国学生比较容易犯的一个问题，因为中国学生在进行论证的时候总是喜欢假大空，但是国外作文需要的是细节。我们在论述的时候列举的例子越详细，清晰，以及合适分数就越高。////　　3、结构顺畅////　 　议论文相对于其他文体来看的话，学生们在写的时候比较容易忽略的就是过渡词还有过渡句。这绝对不仅仅体现在每一个段落的开始要使用一些类似于 first，second, third这样的词汇等等。过渡还体现在句语句之间，甚至句子当中我们也需要过渡词来体现句子的层次。////　　4、词汇句法////　　有这么一句话是词汇语法水平高的文章不一定是高分文章，但是高分文章一定是词汇语法水平高的文章。所以毫无疑问词汇和语法在整个文章中占有着很重要的地位。////////</string>
